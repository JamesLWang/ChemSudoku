# ${1:Sudo-Chem}
## Introduction

Unlike your ordinary Sudoku game, this project requires you to answer a chemistry question if you insert the wrong value. 
Incorrect answers would result in further point deductions while correct answers will result in positive impact on your score. 

## Installation and Usage

Java is required to run Chem-Sudoku. Download the entire repository, and run Sudoku.java.
